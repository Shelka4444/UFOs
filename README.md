# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project: 
  UFO sightings have been reported throughout the millenia. To date, despite the growing list of incidents, the existence of UFOs has not been conclusively agreed upon neither by scientists, governments, nor the general populace. The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic website of collected UFO sightings. Using JavaScript, users are able to filter the data by multiple criteria such as by date, city, state, country, and shape of the reported unidentifiable flying object. It is up to the user's discretion to decide whether the evidence is conclusive or not to determine the existence of UFOs in our universe.

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
  The top of the webpage contains an eye-catching header and a short introduction about the possibilty of UFOs in the universe.

  Below the introduction, the user will see a table displaying UFO sightings with information categorized by date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments. A corresponding search filter is located to the left of the table.

  The user is able to filter the table by multiple criteria such as date, city, state, country, and shape. The table resets by pressing "UFO Sightings" at the top left hand corner of the webpage.

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
  Though the dynamic nature of this website is easy to use, there is room for improvement. The main drawback of this design is the limited data set being drawn upon. It would be better if the data included observations from a wider range of dates, locations, and also include the number of witnesses for each event. Another useful design feature to add would be a visible counter to return the number of results per search (including the number of total results available without filters). This would allow the user to perhaps make some sort of statistics based conclusion using the presented database for reference. Likewise, adding a feature in the backend which would ignore capital letters in the search filter would be a wise addition since some people will instinctively type in "CA" to filter by state, for example, which returns 0 counts instead of "ca" which returns 29 incidents. An additional recommention would be to also include an easy to locate reset filters button underneath the search system.
